# Integer Order

When `nav_order` fields are integers, the pages are ordered in increasing order of the numerical values.

Integers include `0` and negative values. Integers can be reused for top-level pages and for different sets of child pages. 

1.  Check that the titles of the children of this page are shown in the order:
    ```
    -1
    0
    2
    10
    ```
