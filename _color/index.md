# About Color Tests

The [code](code.html) page shows the highlighting of Ruby code.
In the dark mode, the contrast seems too low.

The [Markdown](../docs/markdown.html) page also has a couple of code examples.
Perhaps the contrast used for task lists (both open and done) is also too low.

In future, we should test both light and dark mode for WCAG compliance.
