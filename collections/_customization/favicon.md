# âœ… Favicons

1.  Build and serve this tests website locally.

1.  Check that both your local build of this website and the theme docs website show the same favicon.

1.  Move `favicon.ico` to `assets/images/`.

1.  Check that the favicon has disappeared, and that Jekyll does *not* report "ERROR '/favicon.ico' not found".

1.  Set `favicon_ico: /assets/images/favicon.ico`, then rebuild this website.

1.  Check that the favicon has reappeared.

1.  Move the favicon back to the root directory, and remove the setting of `favicon_ico`.
