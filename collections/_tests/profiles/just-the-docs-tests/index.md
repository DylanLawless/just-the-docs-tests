# Just the Docs Tests

The _Just-the-Docs Tests_ webiste provides regression tests and examples of use for the _Just the Docs_ theme.

The profiles were produced using a clone of the source repo, last updated on 2023-06-08.

The build created about 150 pages, organised mostly in 11 collections of various sizes, 
including several three-level hierarchies with a variety of navigation orders.
