# HTML validation

1.  Check that [validation of the theme docs home page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjust-the-docs.github.io%2Fjust-the-docs%2F) displays:

    > **Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.**

    (It currently displays 81 Infos.
    Some of them come from `jekyll-seo-tag`,
    but most are from the HTML that the home page uses to display the avatar images of contributors.)

1.  Check that [the theme docs have no broken links](https://validator.w3.org/checklink?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjust-the-docs.github.io%2Fjust-the-docs%2F&summary=on&hide_type=all&recursive=on&depth=6&cookie=nochanges&check=Check),
    except for examples such as `https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/index-test/another-page`.
