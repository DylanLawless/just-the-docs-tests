# Excluded and Untitled

This page does not have a `title`, and that would normally exclude it from the navigation.
However, it is located in a Jekyll collection, which provides default titles.

To exclude a title-less page from the navigation,
regardless of whether it is located in a collection, set `nav_exclude: true`.
