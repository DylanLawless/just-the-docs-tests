1.  Check that no external links are shown in the navigation panel.

1.  Add the following to `_config.yml`:

    ```yaml
    nav_external_links:
      - title: This site on GitHub
        url: https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-tests
        # hide_icon: true
    ```

    Then rebuild the site.
