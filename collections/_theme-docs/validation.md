# âœ… HTML validation

Check that [validation of the theme docs home page](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjust-the-docs.github.io%2Fjust-the-docs%2F) displays:

> **Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show.**

It currently displays 81 Infos.
Some of them come from `jekyll-seo-tag`,
but most are from the HTML that the home page uses to display the avatar images of contributors.
