# Testing Home

First, let's test the instructions on the [Just the Docs home page](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/).

## Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

Added this page at `index.md` with front matter:

```yml
---
title: Home
layout: default
---
```

1. Install the Ruby Gem

    ```shell
    $ gem install just-the-docs

    Successfully installed just-the-docs-0.3.3
    Parsing documentation for just-the-docs-0.3.3
    Done installing documentation for just-the-docs after 0 seconds
    1 gem installed
    ```

    The following alternative assumes that one already has a `Gemfile`,
    which can be created using `jekyll new`, but isn't essential.
    
    ```ruby
    # .. or add it to your your Jekyll siteâ€™s Gemfile
      gem "just-the-docs"
    ```

2. Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll siteâ€™s `_config.yml`

    `_config.yml`:

    ```yml
    title: Just the Docs Tests
    theme: just-the-docs
    ```

3. Skipped: _Optional_: Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)

    _Warning: This step also seems superfluous: search works locally without it._

4. Run your local Jekyll server

    ```shell
    $ jekyll serve
    
    Configuration file: .../just-the-docs-tests/_config.yml
                Source: .../just-the-docs-tests
           Destination: .../just-the-docs-tests/_site
     Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
          Generating... 
                        done in 0.356 seconds.
     Auto-regeneration: enabled for '.../just-the-docs-tests'
        Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
      Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
    ```

5. Point your web browser to <http://localhost:4000>

That worked okay for me: 
my browser (Safari on macOS) shows a correctly formatted website
using Just the Docs.

## Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

- Add Just the Docs to your Jekyll siteâ€™s `_config.yml` as a remote theme

    `_config.yml` updated to:

    ```yml
    title: Just the Docs Tests
    theme: just-the-docs
    remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs
    ```
    
    Using the gem-based theme still works.
    But the site doesn't build on Pages:
    
    ```
    Configuration file: /github/workspace/./_config.yml
    Theme: just-the-docs
    github-pages 227 | Error:  The just-the-docs theme could not be found.
    ```
    
    Commenting-out the `theme` doesn't format pages properly:
    
    ```
    Build Warning: Layout 'default' requested in index.md does not exist.
    ```

    Putting the `remote_theme` _before_ the `theme` eliminates the build warning
    when using the gem-based theme.
    
    But building the site on Pages gives the same error as beforeâ€¦ ðŸ˜–
    
So it seems that to get a site that builds both locally and on Pages,
we need to _remove_ the `theme` and _use a `Gemfile`_!?

The docs include the following advice:

> If youâ€™re hosting your site on GitHub Pages, 
> [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
> so that you can more easily work in your development environment.

That page includes:

> Prerequisites
> 
> Before you can use Jekyll to test a site, you must:
> 
> - Install Jekyll.
> - Create a Jekyll site. For more information, 
>     see "[Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)."

There we find:

> [Creating your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll#creating-your-site)
> ...
> (7) To create a new Jekyll site, use the jekyll new command:
>   ```shell
>   $ jekyll new --skip-bundle .
>   # Creates a Jekyll site in the current directory
>   ```

So we run:

```shell
$ jekyll new --skip-bundle .
Conflict: .../just-the-docs-tests exists and is not empty.
          Ensure .../just-the-docs-tests is empty or else try again with `--force` to proceed and overwrite any files.
 
$ jekyll new --skip-bundle --force .
New jekyll site installed in .../just-the-docs-tests. 
Bundle install skipped. 
```

That has written the following files:

- `_posts`: a new folder containing a post with a welcome message
- `_config.yml`: overwritten with the standard Jekyll site config 
    (15 lines of YAML, 40 lines of comments)
- `.gitignore`: appended `vendor`
- `404.html`
- `about.markdown`
- `Gemfile`
- `index.markdown`: a dummy home page

__Ignore the other steps on the GitHub web pages for now!__

Edit `_config.yml`:

- Comment-out all lines
- Add the following lines:
    
    ```yml
    title: Just the Docs Tests
    remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs
    ```

Edit `Gemfile`:

- Replace `gem "minima", "~> 2.5"` by:

    ```ruby
    `gem "just-the-docs"`
    ```

In `Gemfile` replace:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
end
```

by:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
  gem "rake"

```

- Delete `index.markdown` to resolve the reported conflict.
- Delete `about.markdown`, which is about the Jekyll default theme.
- Ignore (or delete) `_posts/2022-07-14-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown`.

Just the Docs Tests now builds as desired locally, with this single page as `Home`!

Commit the changes to the repository on GitHub.

GitHub Pages now builds the site successfully!

Question:

> Is there a simpler way to configure a site using Just the Docs
> so that it builds both locally _and_ on GitHub Pages?

Answer:

> Yes: use a template!
